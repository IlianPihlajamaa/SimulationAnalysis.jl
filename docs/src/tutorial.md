# Tutorial

This tutorial shows how to use `SimulationAnalysis.jl` to load a simulation and calculate the radial distribution function.

## 1. Load a simulation

First, we need to load a simulation. The package provides several functions for loading different types of simulations, either generated by LAMMPS or by `SimulationCode.jl`. In this tutorial, we will use `read_WCA_simulation` to load a simulation of a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) fluid.

```julia
using SimulationAnalysis

# Path to the simulation file
filename = "path/to/your/simulation.txt"

# Time step of the simulation
dt = 0.005

# Load the simulation
sim = read_WCA_simulation(filename, dt)
```

## 2. Calculate the radial distribution function

Now that we have loaded the simulation, we can calculate the radial distribution function, g(r).

```julia
# Number of bins for the g(r)
Nbins = 100

# Maximum radius for the g(r)
rmax = 10.0

# Calculate the g(r)
bin_centres, gr = find_radial_distribution_function(sim, Nbins, rmax)
```

## 3. Plot the results

Finally, we can plot the results using a plotting package of your choice. For example, using `Plots.jl`:

```julia
using Plots

plot(bin_centres, gr, xlabel="r", ylabel="g(r)", legend=false)
```
